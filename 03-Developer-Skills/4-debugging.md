### What is a software bug?

- Software bug: Defect or problem in a computer program.
  Basically, any **unexpected or unitended behavior** of a computer program is a software bug.
- Bugs are **completely normal** in software development!

### The debugging process
- Becoming aware that there is a bug
  Identify bugs : During production
                  Testing software
                  User reports during production
                  Context: borwsers, users, etc.

- Isolating where exactly the bug is happening in code
  Find bugs: Developer console
             Debugger                  

- Correct bugs
  Fix: Replace wrong solution with new correct solution

- Preventing it from happening again
  Prevent: Searching for the same bug in similar code
           Writing tests using testing software
