### How to think like a developer: Become a problem solver.

1. How to fail at solving problems **whenever encountering a problem**:

- You jump at the problem without much thinking
- You implement your solution in an unstructured way
- you get stressed out when things don't work
- you are too proud to research solutions

2. Fixing a problem:
- Stay calm and slow down, don't just jump at a problem without a plan.
- Take a very logical and rational approach(programming is just logic, in the end...)

### 4 steps to solve any problem:
1. Make sure you 100% understand the problem. Ask the right questions to get a clear picture of the problem.
2. Divide and conquer: Break a big problem into smaller sub-problems.
3. Do not be afraid to do as much research as you have to.
4. For bigger problems, write pseudo-code before writing the actual code.
