### Learning how to code

1. How to fail at learning how to code

- Not **having a clear goal** at the beginning of your journey
- You started by watching courses and reading tutorials, but he would just **copy the code without caring how it works.** Sometimes he would just copy and paste code!
- You **didn't reinforce** what you were learning by doing small challenges or taking notes.
- You **didn't practice coding,** and didn't come up with your own project idea.
- You **quickly became frustrated** when your code was not perfectly clean or efficient.
- You **lost motivation** because you thought you could never know everything.
- You were **learning in isolation**.
- After finishing a couple of courses, **you thought you now are a web developer** and could start applying to jobs. But you couldn't even build an app on your own!

2. How to succeed at learning how to code

- Set a **specific, measurable, realistic** and **time-based** goal.
- Know exactly **why** you are learning to code: Switching careers? Finding a better job?
- **Imagine a bit project** you want to be able to build!
- research technologies you need and then learn them.
- Understand the code that you're studying and typing.
**Always type the code**, don't copy-paste.
- After you learn a new feature or concept, **use it immediately.
- take notes.
- **Challenge yourself** and practice with small coding exercise and challenges.
-Don't be in a hurry to complete the course fast!
- Practising on your own is the most important thing to do
- **This is not optional!** Without **practice outside the courses,** you won't go anywhere!
- Come up with your own project ideas or copy popular sites or applications, or just parts of them in the beginning.
- Don't be stuck in ""tutorial hell".
- **Don't get stuck** trying to write the perfect code!
- Just write tons of code, **no matter the quality!**
- Clean and efficient code will come with time.
- You can always refactor code later.
- Embrace the fact that **you will never know everything**.
- Just focus on what you need to achieve your goal!
- Explain new concepts to other people. If you can explain it, you truly understand it!
- Share your goals to make **yourself accountable.**
- Courses are an amazing starting point, but are only the **beginning of your journey!**
