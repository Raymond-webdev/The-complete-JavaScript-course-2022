## Inheritance between ES6 classes

### Implementing JavaScript inheritance using extends and super
- Prior to ES6, implementing a proper inheritance required multiple steps. One of the most commonly used strategies is prototypal inheritance. 

The following illustrates how the Bird inherits properties from the Animal using the prototypal inheritance technique:
```
function Animal(legs) {
    this.legs = legs;
}

Animal.prototype.walk = function() {
    console.log('walking on ' + this.legs + ' legs');
}

function Bird(legs) {
    Animal.call(this, legs);
}

Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Bird.prototype.constructor = Animal;


Bird.prototype.fly = function() {
    console.log('flying');
}

var pigeon = new Bird(2);
pigeon.walk(); // walking on 2 legs
pigeon.fly();  // flying
```

### ES6 simplified these steps by using the extends and super keywords.

- The following example defines the Animal and Bird classes and establishes the inheritance through the extends and super keywords.
```
class Animal {
    constructor(legs) {
        this.legs = legs;
    }
    walk() {
        console.log('walking on ' + this.legs + ' legs');
    }
}

class Bird extends Animal {
    constructor(legs) {
        super(legs);
    }
    fly() {
        console.log('flying');
    }
}


let bird = new Bird(2);

bird.walk();
bird.fly();
```

- The Animal class is called a base class or parent class while the Bird class is known as a derived class or child class. By doing this, the Bird class inherits all methods and properties of the Animal class.

Second, in the Bird‘s constructor, call super() to invoke the Animal‘s constructor with the legs argument.

JavaScript requires the child class to call super() if it has a constructor. As you can see in the Bird class, the super(legs) is equivalent to the following statement in ES5:
```
Animal.call(this, legs);
```
If the Bird class doesn’t have a constructor, you can don’t need to do anything else:
```
class Bird extends Animal {
    fly() {
        console.log('flying');
    }
}
```
It is equivalent to the following class:
```
class Bird extends Animal {
    constructor(...args) {
        super(...args);
    }
    fly() {
        console.log('flying');
    }
}
```
- However, the child class has a constructor, it needs to call super(). For example, the following code results in an error:
```
class Bird extends Animal {
    constructor(legs) {
    }
    fly() {
        console.log('flying');
    }
}
```
