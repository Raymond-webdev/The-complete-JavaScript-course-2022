## Project: "Bankist" app

- In this lecture it's time to take a first look at the application that we're gonna build in this section. We will also take a closer look at these data files for this project and we will also check out the flow chart for this application. 
And the application that we will build through out this section and also the next one it's called Bankist and is actually live on bankist.netlify.app. 
So I invite you to actually try out this application together with me as you watch this video so to get a real good feeling for how it all works. Now this looks a little bit empty and so you can just basically log in.
