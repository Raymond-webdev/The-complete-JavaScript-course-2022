## The reduce method

- The reduce() method executes a user-supplied "reducer" callback function on each element of the array, in order, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element. The final result of running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single value.

- The first time that the callback is run there is no "return value of the previous calculation". If supplied, an initial value may be used in its place. Otherwise the array element at index 0 is used as the initial value and iteration starts from the next element (index 1 instead of index 0).

Perhaps the easiest-to-understand case for reduce() is to return the sum of all the elements in an array:

```
const array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
const initialValue = 0;
const sumWithInitial = array1.reduce(
  (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue,
  initialValue
);

console.log(sumWithInitial);
// Expected output: 10
```
- The reducer walks through the array element-by-element, at each step adding the current array value to the result from the previous step (this result is the running sum of all the previous steps) â€” until there are no more elements to add.
- Parameters
callbackFn
A function to execute for each element in the array. Its return value becomes the value of the accumulator parameter on the next invocation of callbackFn. For the last invocation, the return value becomes the return value of reduce().

The function is called with the following arguments:

accumulator
The value resulting from the previous call to callbackFn. On first call, initialValue if specified, otherwise the value of array[0].

currentValue
The value of the current element. On first call, the value of array[0] if an initialValue was specified, otherwise the value of array[1].

currentIndex
The index position of currentValue in the array. On first call, 0 if initialValue was specified, otherwise 1.

array
The array reduce() was called upon.

initialValue Optional
A value to which accumulator is initialized the first time the callback is called. If initialValue is specified, callbackFn starts executing with the first value in the array as currentValue. If initialValue is not specified, accumulator is initialized to the first value in the array, and callbackFn starts executing with the second value in the array as currentValue. In this case, if the array is empty (so that there's no first value to return as accumulator), an error is thrown.

Return value
The value that results from running the "reducer" callback function to completion over the entire array.
