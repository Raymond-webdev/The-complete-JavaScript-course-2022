### In this lecture we are going to learn about our first data structure and that's going to be **arrays**.
- An array is like a big container into which we can throw variables and then later reference them and that's super important because programming is most of the time all about data.
- The two most important data structures in JavaScript are "arrays" and "object".
Example of arrays:
```
const friends = ["Michael", "Steven", "Peter"];
console.log(friends);
```
