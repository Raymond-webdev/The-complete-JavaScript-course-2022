### Another data structure in JavaScript are the Objects.
- With objects we actually define key value pairs.
Example:
```
const jonas = {
    firstName: "Jonas",
    lastName: "Schmedtmann",
    age: 2037 - 1991,
    job: "teacher",
    friends: ["Michael", "Peter", "Steven"]
};
```

### We say that object "jonas" has 5 properties:
- property firstName with the value of "Jonas" 
- property lastName with the value of "Schmedmann" and so forth...

### Using the curly braces is the easiest object we can create and it's called the object literals syntax.
### the big difference between objects and arrays is that in objects the order of these values does no matter at all when we want to retreave them. In arrays the order in which we specify the elements matter a lot because that's how we access these elements so we can only access array elements using their order number.
### We should use arrays for more ordered data and objects for more unstructered order.
