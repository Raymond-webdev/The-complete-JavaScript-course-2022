### Before continuing to learn JavaScript in this new section we should first activate a special mode in JavaScript called strict mode.
### Strict mode is a special mode that we can activate in javaScript in order to write secure JavaSCript code.
### All we have to do to activate the strict mode is to write the below string at the beginning of the script:
 "use strict";

 - Strict mode forbids us to do certain things and second it creates visible errors in the developer console where in other situations JavaScript would just fail silently.
