## The for loop

### When we talked about the if/else statement in the previous lecture, we mentioned that is a control structure and also that there are more control structures. 
### One of the other control structures are loops.

- for loop keeps running while condition is TRUE.

for (let rep = 1; rep <= 10; rep++){
    console.log("Lifting weights repetition 1");
}
