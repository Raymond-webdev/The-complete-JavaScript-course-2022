## Section intro

-  Now, in this one, we will basically continue learning about basic JavaScript features and syntax, but this time with a focus on more modern JavaScript. 
- So we're gonna dive deeper and to build in data structures like objects, maps, and arrays. We will talk about modern ES6 plus operators, such as destructuring, and optional chaining and we will also take a look at how to work with strings and all this together will then give you a very solid and important foundation for the upcoming sections and projects.
