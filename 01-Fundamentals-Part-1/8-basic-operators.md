### In this lecture we are going to learn about some basic javascript operators.

### An operator basically allows us to transform values or combine multiple values.
There are many categories of operators: 
 - mathematic operators
 - comparison operators 
 - logical operators
 - assignment operators 

1. Mathematical operators
```
 const now = 2037;
 const ageRelu = now - 1988;
 const ageSarah = now - 2018;
 console.log(ageRelu, ageSarah);
```
2. Assignment operators
```
let x = 10 + 5; //15
x += 10; // x =  x + 10 = 25
x *= 4; // x = x * 4 = 100
x++; // x = x + 1
x--;
x--;
console.log(x);
```
3. Comparison operators
```
console.log(ageRelu > ageSarah); // >, >, >=, <=

console.log(ageSarah >= 18);
```
