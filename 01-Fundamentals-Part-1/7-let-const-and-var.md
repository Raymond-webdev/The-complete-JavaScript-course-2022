### In JavaScript, users can declare a variable using 3 keywords that are var, let, and const.

1. var keyword: The var is the oldest keyword to declare a variable in JavaScript.
```
 var a = 10
 console.log(a);
```

2. let keyword: In JavaScript, let is a keyword that is used to declare a block scoped variable.
   With let we can also re-declare the value of the variable.
```
let age = 30;
age = 31;
```
3. const keyword: 
   The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).
   Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.
   Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.
   Variables defined with const have Block Scope.
