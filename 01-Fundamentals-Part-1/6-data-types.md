## Data types

### In javaScript every value is either an object or a primitive value.
### There are 7 primitive data types:
1. Number
2. String
3. Boolean
4. Undefined
5. Null 
6. Symbol
7. BigInt

1. ### **Numbers**
- Number are also called floating point number which means that they always have decimals even if we don't see them or don't define them.

- let age = 23 ;

2. ### **Strings**
- Those are simply a sequence of characters and so they are just used for text and always put them in quotes either double quotes or single quotes otherwise JavaScript will actually confuse them with variables.

- let firstName = "Jonas";

3. ### **Boolean**
- Is essentially a logical type that can only take one of the logical values(true or false).

- let fullAge = true;

4. ### **Undefined**
- Is the value taken by a variable that is not yet defined so without a value.

- let children; 

5. ### **Null**
- It also means "empty value" but it's used in different circumstances.

6. ### **Symbol**
- It simply defines a value that is unique and cannot be changed.

7. ### **BigInt**
- It's for integers that are too large to be represented by the number type so basically it's another type for numbers
