## Statements and expressions

### An expression is a piece of code that produces a value.
- For example 3 + 4 is an expresion because this is going to produce a value.


### A statement is a bigger piece of code that is executed and which does not produce a value on itself.
- Example:
- This statement doesn't really produce a value, all it does it simply declares the variable called "str".
```
if(23 > 10){
    const str = "23 is bigger";
}
```
