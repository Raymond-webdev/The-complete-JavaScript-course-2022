### It's important to know how JavaScript realeases work, it's important for your work as a web developer and also because you will see these topics coming up in the developer community all the time so you want to be able to understand what's going on.

### The best way to start understanding JavaScript versions is by looking at the history of JavaScript.
1. In 1995 Brendan Eich creates the **very first version of JavaScript in just 10 days**. It was called**Mocha** but already had many fundamental features of modern JavaScript!

2. In 1996 **Mocha** changes to LiveScript and then to JavaScript in order to attract Java developers. However **JavaSCript has almost nothing to do with Java**.

3. In 1997, with a need to standardize the language, ECMA releases ECMAScript 1 (ES1), the first **official standard for JavaScript**.

4. In 2009 ES5 is released with lots of great new features.

5. In 2015 ES6 was released:**the biggest upodate to the language ever!**.

6. In 2016: realease of ES2016 / ES2017 / ES2018 / ES2019 / ES2020 / ES2021 / ... /

### there is one particularity about JavaScript releases which is pretty unique for any programming language and that is it's backwords compatibility all the way to ES1.

### How to use modern JavaScript today:

- **During development:** Simply use the latest Google Chrome!
- **During production:** Use Babel to transpile and poyfill your code(Converting back to ES5 to ensure browser compatibility for all users).
- Next there are also the future releases of the language like ES2021, ES2022 and so on.
These feature releases together are many times called ESNext.
