## Values and Variables

1. **A value** is basically a piece of data so it's most fundamental unit of information that we have in programming.
For example the text "Jonas" is a value so if we want to see this in the console then we write:
console.log("Jonas");

2. **A variable** is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence.
Example: 
```
let firstName = "Jonas";
console.log(firstName);
```

3. The way that I named the variable above is called **camelcase**.
- Camelcase means that whenever I have multiple words in a variable name, I write the first word with a lower case and then the next words with an upper case.
- We should not start a variable with a number or an upper case.
- We also need to make sure that our variable names are descriptive.
