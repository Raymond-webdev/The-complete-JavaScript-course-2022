### Boolean logic: The and, or & not operators

- Boolean Logic is a form of algebra which is centered around three simple words known as Boolean Operators: “Or,” “And,” and “Not”. At the heart of Boolean Logic is the idea that all values are either true or false.

**Boolean variables**

age = 16

A: Age is greater or equal to 20 - false
B: Age is less than 30 - true

**Let's use operators**
!A  - true

A AND B - false

A OR B - true

!A AND B - true

A OR !B - false
