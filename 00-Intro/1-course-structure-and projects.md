## JavaScript course structure and projects

The course contains about 20 sections with over 60 hours of video content.
- In the section 2 and 3 we are going to kick of with the very basics of the javascript language.
- In the section 5 we will learn some general skills that we will need as a developer like problem solving, fixing errors and setting up a development enviroment.
- In the section 7 we build our very first project with the user interface so this section is about DOM manipulation and we will build three simple applications.
- In section 8 we will take a detail look behind the scenes of JavaScript to learn how the language actually works.
- In sections 9 and 10 we will keep working on our Javascript fundamentals but now with a focus on more modern ES6 topics such as maps and the destructuring and also strings, functions, closures and more.
- Throughout sections 11 and 12 we will build our next beautiful project which will teach us all we need to know about array methods, numbers, date and timers.
- In section 13 we jump right into our next project which is going to be another beautiful website full packed with visual affect, components such as lazy image loading and so much more.
- In section 14 we finally reach the pretty advanced but also very important topic of **Object Oriented Programming** with constructor functions and ES6 classes.
- In section 15 we are going to build a stunning real world project. This project will teach you how to incorporate a map and how to actually plan and structure a project.
- In section 16 we are going to learn about asynchronous JavaScript whihc is used for things like loading data from external web servers with AJAX.
- In section 17 and 18 we will learn how modern JavaScript applications are actually built using cutting edge technologies like NPM, Babel, Parcel and ES6 modules.
We then take all these modern tools and everything that we have learned up until this point to build this biggest and coolest project in the course.
-  In section 19 we finish the final project by deploying it to the internet using Netlify and GIT.
