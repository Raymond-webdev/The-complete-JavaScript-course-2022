## Section intro

- Welcome to our next project and this one is gonna be the coolest and most real world project so far. So we're gonna apply everything that we learned so far, including advanced stuff, like functions, arrays and object oriented programming. We will also learn some new stuff, like how to use geolocation and how to use third party libraries in our project. 
- But even more importantly, you will also learn how to actually plan a project because building a project is not just writing some code, it's also about thinking and taking decisions and solving problems. And so that's something I really want to teach you, so that eventually, you will be able to build applications on your own.
