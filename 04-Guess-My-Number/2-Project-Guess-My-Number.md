## Here we are going to build a project called "Guess my number".

- The goal of this project is to guess a secret number that is between 1 and 20 by pressing the selected button.
- In order to do that we need to manipulatethe HTML elements.
- In javaScript we can select elements based on their classes.

**Example of selecting an element from the HTML page.**

- console.log(document.querySelector(".message"));

### In order to get the actual text from that class element, we need to type:
- console.log(document.querySelector(".message").textContent);
