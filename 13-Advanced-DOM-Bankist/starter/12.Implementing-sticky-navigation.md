## Implementing the sticky navigation: The scroll Event

- Let's implement another pretty common feature on webpages, which is that the navigation bar becomes attached to the top of the page after we scroll to a certain point.
- And this is called a sticky navigation and so let's build one for our site.
```
// Sticky navigation
const initialCoords = section1.getBoundingClientRect();
console.log(initialCoords);

window.addEventListener("scroll", function() {
  console.log(window.scrollY);

if(window.scrollY > initialCoords.top) nav.classList.add("sticky");
else nav.classList.remove("sticky");
})

```
