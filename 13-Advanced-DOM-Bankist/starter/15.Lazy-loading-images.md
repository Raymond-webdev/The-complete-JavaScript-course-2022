## Lazy loading images

- One of the most important things when building any website is performance.
- And images have by far the biggest impact on page loading and so it's very important that images are optimized on any page and for that we can use a strategy called Lazy Loading Images.
```
// Lazy loading images
const imgTargets = document.querySelectorAll('img[data-src]');

const loadImg = function (entries, observer) {
  const [entry] = entries;

  if (!entry.isIntersecting) return;

  
  // Replace src with data-src
  entry.target.src = entry.target.dataset.src;

  entry.target.addEventListener('load', function () {
    entry.target.classList.remove('lazy-img');
  });

  observer.unobserve(entry.target);
};
```
