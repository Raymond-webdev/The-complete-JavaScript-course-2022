## DOM traversing

- This lecture is gonna be about Traversing the Dom. So Dom traversing is basically walking through the Dom which means that we can select an element based on another element and this is very important because sometimes we need to select elements relative to a certain other element.
- For example, a direct child or a direct parent element or sometimes we don't even know the structure of the Dom at runtime and in all these cases, we need Dom traversing.
 And so let's now work with the h1 element here, and from here we're gonna go downwards, upwards and also sideways. 
- So let's start with 'going downwards.' So basically selecting child elements. So the first way of doing that is to use **querySelector** because we already know that querySelector also works on elements, not only on the document. So let's simply log to the console h1.querySelector.
 ```
const h1 = document.querySelector("h1");

// Going downwards: child

console.log(h1.querySelectorAll(".highlight"));
```
- Finally, there's also first and last element child. 
```
h1.firstElementChild.style.color = "white;
h1.lastElementChild.style.color = "orangered";
```
- Now let's go upwards so basically selecting parents and for direct parents, it's actually very straightforward. 
```
console.log(h1.parentNode);
console.log(h1.parentElement);
```
- Now let's go sideways so selecting siblings, and for some reason in JavaScript, we can only access direct siblings so basically only the previous and the next one.
```
console.log(h1.previousElementSibling);
console.log(h1.nextElementSibling);
```
