## Section Intro

- In this section, we will build a beautiful website project with a lot of different components and visual effects that require some pretty advanced DOM manipulation techniques. 
- So after this section, we will have all the tools that we need in order to implement any visual component or effect that we can imagine. 
- Now, many of the things that are going to be shown in here could actually also be added to a webpage simply by using a third party library but we want to master JavaScript and the DOM and so therefore, we need to know how to do things ourself.
