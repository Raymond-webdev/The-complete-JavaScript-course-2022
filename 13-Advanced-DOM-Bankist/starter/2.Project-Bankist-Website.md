## Project: Bankist website

- So in this section, we're gonna build another project so we're gonna be building the kind of marketing website.
- There are just two small changes that I want to do here in this code before we get started, the first one is,  if we click the "Open account" button, you'll see that the page scrolls to back to the top and that is because this is actually now a link and not a button and on the link when we have the "hash(#)" here as the hyperlink that will make the page jump to the top so that's the default behavior.
-So a way of preventing the default behavior is adding the "preventDefault" function inside the function responsible for opening this model, to get access to the event. 
- And now the second part thatneeds to be fixed is getting rid of this old school **for**  loop that we have here, because now we know of a better way of doing this, which is the, **forEach** loop. 
So we have this buttons open modal and we want to attach an event listener to this button and to the other one below at the same time.  And so that's simply this part:
```
btnsOpenModal.forEach(btn =>addEventListener("click", openModal));
```
- So let's give it a save and that works so with this, our code is a little bit nicer and adapted to this page.
