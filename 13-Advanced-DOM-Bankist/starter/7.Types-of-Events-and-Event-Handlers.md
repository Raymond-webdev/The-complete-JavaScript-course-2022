## Types of Events and Event handlers

### Element: mouseenter event
- The mouseenter event is fired at an Element when a pointing device (usually a mouse) is initially moved so that its hotspot is within the element at which the event was fired.
```
const h1 = document.querySelector("h1");

 const alertH1 = function(e) {
  alert("addEventListener: Great! You are reading the heading");
  
 };
 
 h1.addEventListener("mouseenter", alertH1);

 setTimeOut(() => h1.removeEventListener("mouseenter", alertH1), 3000);


 h1.onmouseenter = function(e){
  alert("addEventListener: Great! You are reading the heading :D");
}
```
