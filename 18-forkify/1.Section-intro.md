## Section intro

- Welcome back to the final project of this course. And in this one, we take everything that we learned throughout the course and put it all into one beautiful, modern, and really advanced application. So we're gonna use things like classes, modules, promises, a single weight, parcel and so much more.
- Also we're gonna dive even deeper into flow charts and project architecture in this project so that you become more and more confident and prepared to actually write applications by yourself.
